# Classes Scraper

This is a web scraper using python and selenium to scrape data on all the
courses for any UCSD quarter. It goes
through [this](https://act.ucsd.edu/scheduleOfClasses/scheduleOfClassesStudentResult.htm)
website.

It can be modified to scrape all classes for any specific department, or it can
also scrape classes for every department.

The data from the scraping is stored in the data folder, in the json file
respective to the quarter.

I started this project intending to create a front-end for it, as a substitute
for WebReg. Maybe I'll get to it some day. If anyone wants to use this and make
the front-end, feel free to do so.
