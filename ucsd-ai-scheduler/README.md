# ## Credits

This project makes use of the following open-source resources:

- [Classes_Scraper](https://github.com/newracket/Classes_Scraper) by Aniket Gupta — Python-based scraper for UCSD course data, used to collect and structure on demand course info for the upcoming quarter.
- [GrAPE (Graphical Assistant for Prerequisite Enrollment)](https://github.com/wllmwu/course-grapher) by William Wu — provided structured prerequisite data for all courses.

I thank the authors for making these resources publicly available. All data and code are used in accordance with their respective licenses and with attribution.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
